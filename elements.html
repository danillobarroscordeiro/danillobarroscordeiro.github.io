									<p>2This project aims to summarize all negative reviews of a product and classify them in one of the topics in a few words to detect which are the main customer complaints about it. The model is deployed in AWS and stakeholders can access these words by entering the product ID in a gradio web API. </p>

									<a href="https://github.com/danillobarroscordeiro/price_elasticity_prediction"><img src="images/price_elasticity.jpg" alt="" /><h2>Laptop Price Elasticity</h2></a>
									<p>This project aims to determine the price elasticity of demand for laptops sold by Best Buy using simple linear regression. The goal is to establish optimal pricing strategies to maximize revenue. Data on significant products with calculated price elasticity is accessible through a Streamlit app. The app also simulates the potential increase in demand and revenue if prices are reduced by 10%. </p>
